%description
libtorrent-rasterbar is a C++ library that aims to be a good
alternative to all the other bittorrent implementations around. It is
a library and not a full featured client. It is not the same as the
other libtorrent, as used by the 'rtorrent' application, that is in
the 'libtorrent' package. The two are completely different and
incompatible.
